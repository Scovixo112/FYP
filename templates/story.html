                        <div>In this book, John Preston gives the reader a kind of “advance map of the territory” to help prepare for the journey of living through emotional pain. He’s written this book to share some of what has been learned about human emotions and emotional healing, to separate fact from fiction. (There’s a lot of fiction out there these days!) The material in this book comes from numerous sources but is drawn primarily from a large body of sound scientific research in psychology. It will help you more fully understand human emotional reactions and, perhaps more important, to look very specifically at ways to help yourself get through difficult times. And, along the way, you’ll see how each of four people — like you, human beings with the capacity to heal — took action that helped them to deal with and grow beyond their emotional pain.</div>

Both the student and the experienced practitioner will find the Dictionary invaluable.

                            Beyond scholarship and integrity, an author who undertakes the preparation of a dictionary, any dictionary, requires compassionate regard for the reader. Chessick knows this, possesses the capacity for it, and does succeed in engaging the reader one-to-one. He declines the role of the anonymous expert’s prescribing what is and what is not correct usage. Quite the contrary, Chessick affirms a personal presence, venturing his views—never arrogating the voice of the unseen, unmoved, unnamed, authorial majesty.</div>

                        <div>Depression is conceptualized here as a self-perpetuating interpersonal system. Depressive symptomatology is congruent with the developing interpersonal situation of the depressed person, and the symptoms have a mutually maintaining relationship with the response of the social environment. Essentially, the depressed person and others within his social space collude to create a system in which feedback cannot be received, and various efforts to change become system-maintaining (61 pgs).</div>

The depressive affect and even many depressive syndromes may be so masked that a nonpsychiatric or even psychiatric physician may be unaware of the fact that a serious emotional disorder is at hand until a massive, full-blown depression erupts and dominates the clinical scene.</div>

Among the strengths of the existentialist stance are: a concern for individuals and their view of their particular circumstances, the realization that the individual is on a life long quest in which transcendence over local circumstances is natural, and acceptance of dread and despair as emotions which attend, motivate and inform actions that determine direction. </div>

It takes as the heart of the clinical problem the patient’s reluctance to change, that ubiquitous and paradoxical phenomenon of our work in which people come to us asking for help in changing, and then do their level best to keep change from happening… This is a work which is at once a practical guide and a theoretical tour de force. Readers who journey in this slim volume with Dr. Stark will return from their travels to their practice much educated, having encountered new ideas and old ones in new forms, better able to face the everyday travails of psychotherapy.”</div>

Indications for psychotherapy exist in every case of primary severe depression. The intensity should not deter the therapist from making psychotherapeutic attempts. Concomitant drug therapy does not make the patient less accessible to psychotherapy.

Even more exceptional, perhaps, is that almost every chapter is remarkably evenhanded and thorough…A valuable contribution to the field. Having coordinated and constructed broad-minded yet discerning review of so many aspects of depression, these editors and authors provide numerous opportunities for the reader to explore and integrate wide-ranging perspectives on affective disorders. Students, faculty, and professionals alike would do well to add this book to their personal libraries.”

                        <div>Dr. Scharff explains how drama and role-playing can be utilized both by medical and mental health practitioners in training, and by patients in the therapy setting. Medical students and therapists can engage in role-play with actors playing the part of patients with medical conditions to be assessed, in this way developing diagnostic acuity and clinical presence for the day when they will be allowed to work with patients. Drama helps patients in therapy encounter their difficulties in an “as if” setting where it is safe to learn from mistakes, explore conflict, and learn from the point of view of others. Drama prepares us to adapt to social change and empowers disadvantaged communities to represent themselves and fight for better conditions. Creative drama in particular affords industrious and imaginate experience that facilitates personal development such that men and women can fulfill their potential for spontaneous and creative living.</div>

                        <div>Hedges introduces the term the organizing experience to chart the course of early trauma to its impact on adult living and the transference situation. He describes the infant’s primary life task as organizing Chanels to the human nurturing environment—first physiological connections to the mother and others. During the organizing experience, inevitable traumas leave memory traces that affect subsequent interpersonal relationships. Even if the infant has the good fortune to be born healthy and into an optimal family environment, he or she must endure intense moments of needing and desiring that are not or cannot be responded to in the exact ways or in the precise time frames the infant needs to maintain a sense of internal harmony and continuity. What then becomes conditioned during the organizing period is a terror and avoidance of certain kinds of interpersonal connections or situations because the infant initially found them traumatizing.</div>

                        <div>Written and illustrated by two psychiatrists-in-training, this book is a cartoon guide to the variety of feelings commonly experienced by beginning psychotherapists and other helping professionals, be they psychiatrists, social workers, counselors, teachers, bartenders, or cab drivers. The various defensive and evasive maneuvers trainees learn to use in order to deal with the complexities and demands of the therapeutic relationships often cause them to feel guilty. They discuss these maneuvers only with great difficulty. The disillusionment of idealistic beginners can end in cynicism and despair or kit can find a middle ground of informed humanism. This witty book gives a sympathetic and insightful view of their anxieties. The authors point out the commonness, necessity, and even therapeutic value of these training experiences. The book also explores the complicated relationship between institutions, supervisors, therapists, and patients and raises important questions about the training of psychotherapists. Here is a fresh and candid view that anyone entering the helping professions will appreciate and that is certain to interest anyone undergoing psychotherapy.</div>
